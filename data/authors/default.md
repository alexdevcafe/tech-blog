Hi! I'm Alex, a software developer based in Seoul, South Korea, and this is alexdev.cafe - my home on the web.

I've created this resource with the purpose to share useful tips and tricks about programming. As I learn something new or review something old, I hope to share this knowledge with everyone through this blog.

Knowledge is power but only if it's being shared.
