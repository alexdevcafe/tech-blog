Hi, Alex here. Iâ€™m a software developer based in Seoul, South Korea. I specialize in building robust applications with typescript.
I prefer using React for web apps and React Native for mobile development unless I need to access more native capabilities, then I go with Swift or Java.

Through this blog and my youtube channel, I hope to share bits and pieces on programming and practical tips on building apps.
