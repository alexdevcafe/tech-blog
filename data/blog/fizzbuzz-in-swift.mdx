The well-known "Fizzbuzz" test is a straightforward coding assignment that software companies use to find out whether job candidates are capable of writing code.

The task is as follows:

> Write a function that prints out numbers from 1 to 100. If the number is divisible by 3 and 5, print out **FizzBuzz**. Else, if the number is divisible by 3, print out **Fizz**, or if it's divisible by 5, print out **Buzz**

Let's solve this task using [Swift](https://www.swift.org/).

## For loop and conditionals

The very first and the most "naive" way of solving this would be by using a for a loop.

```swift
func fizzbuzz() {
    for i in 1...100 {
        if(i % 3 == 0 && i % 5 == 0){
            print("FizzBuzz")
        } else if(i % 3 == 0){
            print("Fizz")
        } else if(i % 5 == 0){
            print("Buzz")
        } else {
            print(i)
        }
    }
}
```

## Pattern matching and map

This one is more elegant yet simple in a way. We fill an [Array](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/array) with numbers from 1 to 100, then map the results and use Swift's [Pattern Matching](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/ReferenceManual/Patterns.html) to match and print out the results.

```swift
func fizzbuzz() {
    Array(1...100).map { i in
        switch(i % 3 == 0, i % 5 == 0){
        case (true, true):
            print("FizzBuzz")
        case (true, false):
            print("Fizz")
        case (false, true):
            print("Buzz")
        default:
            print(i)
        }
    }
}
```
