Welcome to my tech blog. It's the first-ever post in the history of this blog.

My full-time developer job keeps me busy, but I hope to write more posts as often as I can. There's no 100% guarantee of that happening cos of how busy life can sometimes get.

I want to write various posts on various aspects of programming. Hope that this content will be insightful.

Cheers,
Alex from AlexDevCafe
