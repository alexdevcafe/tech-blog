TypeScript is an open-source programming language developed at Microsoft with the intent to add type safety to type-unsafe JavaScript.
TypeScript is a strongly typed superset of JavaScript that compiles into JavaScript and powerfully extends it with additional features.

_Description_: All of TypeScript's features on top of JavaScript. Everything that is possible in pure JavaScript is
also possible in TypeScript.

# Pros

The major advantage of TypeScript is its capability to expand JavaScript's features with an additional layer of static types.

- **Strong typing** - a powerful instrument to prevent type errors
- **Type annotations** we can specify what type a variable should have
- **Structural type system** - helps us to define a whole structure we are going to use
- **Type Inference** - automatic type detection

### Additional features

Since TypeScript is a superset of JS, it can accomplish everything that JavaScript can and even more. Additionally, TypeScript's Object-oriented Programming(OOP) syntax provides out-of-box support for interfaces, enumerated types, generics, as well as other features.

### Catching errors at compile-time

Your code gets checked during compile-time, thus reducing potential errors with bugs.

### Smooth developer experience

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) IDE - another outstanding product of Microsoft has built-in support for TypeScript and provides handy hints as you type. And because TypeScript knows about arguments and types you pass to some specific functions, your code refactoring process becomes much faster and less painful. TS automatically highlights parts in your code that you should update.

### Clear communication

Developers can see the intention behind the other person's code because code written in TypeScript is self-documenting.

### Popularity

TypeScript is widely used, trusted by big companies, has a huge community of supporters, and is consistently being maintained gaining new features.

# Cons

### Learning Curve

If you are not familiar with typing systems in other languages and lack exposure to OOP, then be prepared to dig TS docs and learn about its typing system. At first, it will take some time and practice to learn how to use TS effectively.

### Slow Development

It can take more time to set up TS-based projects. If you don't rely on basic type-inference, you may find it tedious and sometimes frustrating to type everything manually.

### False Sense of Security

TypeScript performs type checking only at compile-time, which means that it compiles into pure JavaScript, then runs. As a result, some bugs the TS compiler didn't discover may occur at runtime.

# Conclusion

Though you can't conquer TypeScript in a day, and its syntax might seem a bit wordy, there are great reasons for adopting this strictly typed programming language.

With TypeScript, you can make your code management easier by explicitly defining types or forcing constraints where needed. You can get instant feedback from TypeScript at compile-time, reduce possible errors, and build well-organized scalable applications. All in all, adding TypeScript to any of your projects is a good investment in the quality of your codebase.
